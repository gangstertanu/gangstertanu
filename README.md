I'm a Front End Developer practitioner and computer programmer with an avid interest in UI/UX and Designing. As a core programmer, I love taking challenges and love being part of the solution.

I have hands on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Deployment of Apps. Solid Programming expertise in JavaScript, Object Oriented analysis/methodologies.

Technologies that I have experience on :

- React
- Web Designing
- Web Development
- SQL


When in times of leisure, I like to read books in the genre of mystery thriller, pyschology, and self-help. I am usually found practicing programming or reading a book to gain knowledge about the stuff that I don't know or with the intention of deep diving into stuff that I already now.
